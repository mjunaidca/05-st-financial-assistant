# Convert Step 01 Financial Analyst Project to Streamlit App with Prompt Enjineering

#### Prompt Iteration 1:

Convert this uploaded jupyter notebook concept app into a stream-lit app

1. Save Assistant Class in a seperate assistant.py file/
2. Save all helper functions in a utils.oy file
3. Import them in streamlit-app.py file and convert and continue transforming remaining app in this file
4. Design arxhitecture. to Initialize properly session state variables in stream lit
5. Use streamlit st.chat_input and st.cht_message to easily build the finance ai whiz chat dashboard. In sidebar log the assistent response and show useful information.
6. Keep minimal styling

Share a zip file to be downloaded and run. Analyze the code and share zip only

Results: Got a zip file with basic setup.

### Prompt Iteration 2

Continuing in same chat the next prompt was:

```
In assistant.py add the FinancialAssistantManager class

In the streamlit-app.py file initialize this assistant and complete the app

Firstly initialize the assistant. etc.

Get user input using st.chat_input

Follow the code logic to retrive response and display it.


Revice and share the new zip
```

Results:

Still not upto the mark

### Prompt Iteration 3:

I decided to upload another assistant "stock data assistant repo zip to see if we can analyze and get more better code. Combining above two prompts with this idea our inteructions were:

```
Review the rahoo finance assistant code in attached github repo zip file. This will help you understand the flow of streamlit app.

Now Convert this uploaded jupyter notebook concept app into a stream-lit app. Use the same architecture as in uploaded zip and improve it.

1. Save Assistant Class in a seperate assistant.py file/
2. Save all helper functions in a utils.oy file
3. Import them in streamlit-app.py file and convert and continue transforming remaining app in this file
4. Design arxhitecture. to Initialize properly session state variables in stream lit
5. Use streamlit st.chat_input and st.cht_message to easily build the finance ai whiz chat dashboard. In sidebar log the assistent response and show useful information.

In assistant.py add the FinancialAssistantManager class

In the streamlit-app.py file initialize this assistant and complete the app

Firstly initialize the assistant. etc.

Get user input using st.chat_input

Follow the code logic to retrive response and display it.

Share a converted jyoyter notebook to streamlit app zip file to be downloaded and run. Analyze the code and share zip only
```

Better than before but the results was mixed from zip and ipunb file.

So I refined prompt a bit further:

## Prompt Iteration 4:

Review the rahoo finance assistant code in attached github repo zip file. This will help you understand the flow of streamlit app.

Now Convert this uploaded jupyter notebook concept app into a new stream-lit app. Use the same architecture as in uploaded zip to create a new stream app repo and share.

Here are basic guidelines

1. Save Assistant Class in a seperate assistant.py file/
2. Save all helper functions in a utils.oy file
3. Import them in streamlit-app.py file and convert and continue transforming remaining app in this file
4. Design arxhitecture. to Initialize properly session state variables in stream lit
5. Use streamlit st.chat_input and st.cht_message to easily build the finance ai whiz chat dashboard. In sidebar log the assistent response and show useful information.

In assistant.py add the FinancialAssistantManager class

In the streamlit-app.py file initialize this assistant and complete the app

Firstly initialize the assistant. etc.

Get user input using st.chat_input

Follow the code logic to retrive response and display it.

Share the zip folder only

Results: This time we got much improved results

Firstly empty files with our flow

Next We got the updated streamlit code. Still only half cooked code in each file.

Before quitted I asked : `Now add complete code to each file from the provided jupyter notebook` and then
`rather than placeholder add the complete code from uploaded juypyter notebook initially to complete this app`

A few imports were missing but we got much of the code boiler plate.

Next I requested:

Now that placeholders are filled complete the streamlit app

The placeholders were placed properly
